<hr>
<p>Personal project is a new journey in which students of MYP5 delve into problems which the world faces and they provide solutions to ensure that the problem is solved. The project is a combination of the topics learnt throughout the 4 stages of MYP</p>
<p>The main journey of the project begins from MYP 4, in which students first go through an exhibition in which the current MYP 5 batch explain their project. After going through the exhibition, they are given a session on what the personal project is and how it should be achieved. The main deadline of the project is during the summer vacations, since the evaluation of the project takes place during the 1st term of MYP 5, for the new batch. </p>
<p>The project I would be taking up during the Personal Project 2023-24 of Pathways School Gurgaon is on promoting technology in rural arts, in the field of Mithila painting </p>
<p>Madhu Mithila is a project taken up by Aarav Shrivastava, who is 15-yr-old boy. In this, the main aim is to promote technology in rural art, especially in Madhubani art, to ensure that the artists earn more income through selling their artworks online. </p>
<p>This is a project which is collaborating hands with Jeevika foundation, which is a government driven foundation in the state of Bihar. We would be collaborating with the SHG's, or the Self Help Group </p>
<h4><b>About Jeevika foundation</b></h4>
<p>Jeevika foundation is a government driven found by the government of Bihar</p>
<p>This foundation focuses on spreading social and economic empowerment towards the uneducation and underprivileged people. The foundation works under Central Scheme Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojna, which aims to let all underprivileged citizens access self employment. This scheme has already been successful. Since it success, the government announced NRLM, which aims to spread self employment opportunities across whole India. There are certain levels of consultations</p>
<p>Some of the consultations are available in</p>
<p>-district level</p>
<p>-state level</p>
<p>-national level</p>
<p>Some of the departments in Jeevika are</p>
<p>-DRDA's</p>
<p>-Civil Society</p>
<p>-NGO's</p>
<p>-Bankers</p>
<p>-Educational and research institutions</p>
<p>Another Project is the SPIP, which aims to end poverty in households, and increase self employment. With these approaches, we would be seeing a drastic improvement and build more strong institutions. </p>
<p>Principles of Jeevika are</p>
<p>Making a vibrant experience of banking for women community</p>
<p>Through banking in women community, we would be able to understand about member saving, internal loaning and revolving fund</p>
<p>The primary levels, SHG's, also known as Self Help Group, starts in a village, in which they create clusters. Through clusters, they learn to become membership based social service citizens, business entities and clients of a formal banking system. The project is designed to focus on building self-run model of a community in which women get work experience. </p>
<p>SHG only focuses on 6 districts and they are made since the gradual increase in poverty. The VO, or Village Organization, focuses on food development in villages</p>
<p>Meetins are required for Village Organizations, where the community discusses how much food should be purchased and which type of food should we be eating.</p>
<h4><b>Main aim of Jeevika</b></h4>
<p>Improve livelihood and improve economic and social area of the rural sector</p>
<p>Help poor people access to services and jobs</p>
<p>Promote development in the country from real life job experience</p>
<h4><b>Livelihood</b></h4>
<p>This is an initiative taken by Jeevika, in which the objective is to enhance productivity growth for employment generation. This would only be achieved through investment in technology, service provision, and setting up of market mechanism. 80% of livelihood depens on agricultural labor, and agricultural dependence is based on sharing crops like Paddy</p>
<p>For improving food security in Bihar, productivity of Paddy should be increasig through different systems of rice intensification and participatory varietal selection. Also, cattle rearing is a part of livelihood. Through different initiative of cattle rearing and paddy, the project remains a huge success</p>

<hr>
<p>Madhubani art was originated from the city of Mithila, where the Ramayana character, Lord Sita was born. These paintings were considered to show stories of Indian epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. Some of the potrayal of Madhubani art in some of the paintings are the Swayamwara of Sita, in which Rama broke the might bow of Lord Shiva and married Lord Sita</p>
<p>This form of art is also called as Kulin art, which is also known as arts of the Caste. These artworks are also made to show practices and reforms</p>
<p>These paintings are done in canvases, papers and walls, and the purpose of making this artwork is based on dualism<p>
<p>By the time of 1934, this painting was rediscovered by British Colonial Officer Sir William G Archer in the Madhubani district</p>
<p>The paintings are made based on figurate and non figurate wall paintings.</p>
<p5 class="text-muted text-center" style="background-color:aquamarine;">Kohbar is the most illustrative painting in Madhubani art and is divided into 3 parts</p>
<p style="background-color:beige;">Kohbar of North Bihar- 1st Image</p>

  <b>PROBLEMS FACED BY THE ARTISTS WHILE MAKING THE ARTWORK</b>
<p>Some of the problems which the Madhubani artists faced while making the artwork is-</p>
<p>1-If any error is made while making the artwork, that is discarded, or otherwise thrown, which results into waste of resource</p>
<p>2-Buyer taking all the credits. While teaching the artists how to draw digitally in Madhubani, the artists first expressed one of the problems they face while making their artworks. The first problem they told was the buyer taking credit of making the artwork. It was considered that while the artists would put up their exhibition on their artworks, they would sell them. But, once the buyer purchases the artwork, they consider that they made the artwork by their own and then take all the credits, which makes the artists feel upset.</p> 
<p>3-Buying the canvas. One of the artist said that in todays generation, they use canvas to paint their paintings, but for buying the canvas, it depends on the meter. One canvas per meter costs 500 rs, which some of the artists cannot afford, but they have no option, but to spend their hard earned cash. </p>

        <b>HOW CAN WE USE TECHNOLOGY IN RURAL ART</b>
        <p>These days, we have started to use technology in different areas of work, like creating product or selling them</p>
        <p>Half of use of technology is coming under selling products and coding apps, and websites. We use different applications for coding a website, like Visual Studio Code, Brackets, Codepen, for coding with HTML, CSS and JS, whereas we can also use another platform named Wix, which does not require coding and is easy in terms of making the aesthetics. For making apps, we use applications like Thunkable, Code.Org, and others. We have also started to make chatbots, and the most famous chatbot of all times is obviously, CHATGPT, which was developed by Microsoft</p>
        <p>As we use technology in creating the websites and apps, we have also started to use technology in arts, when it comes to painting and sculpturing. When we draw digitally, we get an idea of what we want to create exactly and what we want to impress the audiences with. We use Adobe Photoshop, MS Paint to make different artworks, using different paints, but the use of Adobe Photoshop is most commonly known since we can make more detailed artworks.</p>
        <p>This time, in the project, I would like to promote the use of digital art to the traditional artists of Bihar's Madhubani artists, using Krita in a touchpad laptop and Sketchbook for drawing in Mobile phone.</p>

        <span class="sp" onclick="getElementbyid()">
        <img src="krita.jpg" width="300" height="300">
        <p>Krita is an application for drawing digitally, and that can only be used when you have a touchscreen laptop. Even if you do not have a touchscreen laptop, then you can either use a graphic tablet, which has a tablet and an online pen, or you can also use a digital pen, which will also help you to draw in a laptop. Only Krita would be available in Laptops and not in phone. For phone, the another app which will help you draw digitally is Sketchbook. Sketchbook has the same features like Krita, but in this, you are already given options of choosing your size, like A4 size or A3 size. In this, you can also change the color scheme as per your artwork and you can draw with your hands easily in this mobile application. </p>

      <b>TRAINING ARTISTS HOW TO DRAW DIGITALLY</b>
      <p>For this project, I have went to Madhubani and met with the artists. Once I reached Madhubani, I saw the artist making different artworks, but with acrylic paint since they told that during the old times, they would extract color from different sources like leaf. The artworks which some of the artists were making were on the cloths of a saree and dupatta</p>
      <p>For this visit, we took help with one of the Jeevika members, whose name was Satish. He used to work long back ago in Madhubani, with Jeevika only, and he felt good which coming back to Madhubani and seeing how the artists still continue to make great artworks. </p>
      <p>Firstly, before showing the prototype website I had made, I asked some questions to them on the artworks they have made. For example, some of the questions I have asked during the meet where how do you make your artwork in today's time, what are the problems faced while making the artwork. Some of the responses they gave were, whenever they make their artwork, they use canvas. For buying a canvas, the cost depends on the meter, and each canvas per meter is 500 rupees, which is really expensive while buying. So the artist manage to buy the canvas and make artworks on that. The second answer they gave was, whenever they sell their artworks to the people, the buyer takes all the credits for the artwork, claiming that he or she made the artwork, when all the artists gets all the credit for making the original artwork. </p>

      <img src="2i.jpg" width="300" height="300">
      </span>
      <p>To carry things forward, I have introduced them to Madhu Mithila, in which I have explained that how will their incomes increase by selling their artwork digitally. They also told us that whenever they sell their artworks, their profit would increase. While I explained about how can their artworks be sold online, and while their artworks is sold online, how their income will increase more. After talking about Madhu Mithila, one of the artists, Narmada Devi, was interested in drawing online. So, I thought all the artist how to use Krita first. Some of the features that I have included were drawing using different brushes, increasing brush sizes, using shapes to draw directly and how to choose size. While teaching about how to draw online, the artists added their input on having the size 12in x 24in. After teaching them how to use Krita, the artists preferred to draw on mobile instead of laptop. So, then I have taught them how to use Sketch, which is another platform in which artists can draw digitally. The main difference in Sketchbook and Krita is the changing of color. In this, you can erase easily, but not draw using shapes. So, I also told them about Sketchbook, and one of the artist was keen to know more, which is why she drew her ow artwork on the phone, and it impressed me. Other artists got inspired to make artworks online, and then, I downloaded Sketchbook app in everyone's phone. From that on, the project for the artists had just begun...</p>
